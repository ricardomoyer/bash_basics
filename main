The command "gzip" + name_of_file compresses a file and renames it to a file with extension .gz.
In the example, after compressing "test.txt", it is impossible to apply the function "cat", 
but when decompressing it with the function "gzip -d" + name_of_file, it returns to the original extension, 
so the file "test.txt" responds to the command "cat".

The "diff" command analyzes two files and prints the lines that are different. 
In essence, it outputs a set of instructions for how to change one file to make it identical to the second file. 
In this case the files are 'a.txt' and 'b.txt'.

The first line of the diff output will contain line numbers corresponding to the first file, a letter (a: add, c: change, or d: delete), and
line numbers corresponding to the second file.Then:
Lines preceded by a < are lines from the first file.
Lines preceded by > are lines from the second file.
